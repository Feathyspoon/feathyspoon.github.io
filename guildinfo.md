This website is intended for my guildmembers but if you have found your way here, you may want to join us.

The guild is called Slightly Reunited.

We raid on Ravencrest on Sundays and Monday. Both 20.00 till 23.00. Right now we're 8/9M and working on Phase two with Jaina. We're taking it more and more serious
