## Unlocking the new Azerite essence system

Once Patch 8.2 hits, the first things you'll want to do is unlock your new Azerite Power. This takes about 20 minutes. It's good to do this on your alts as well, because you will immediately jump to Azerite level 35. There are no requirements to unlock the first essence.

1. Speak to King Greymane on the Alliance ship to go to Nazjatar
2. Follow the quest line until you unlock the portal to Boralus (this takes about 10 minutes)
3. Magni will now appear in Nazjatar next to Jaina. He'll send you to the Chamber of the Heart.
4. Go to the Chamber of the Heart and then follow the quest line to Highmountain
5. Kill about 6 mobs during this quest and then go back to the Chamber of the Heart to get your first essence. This also takes 10 minutes. Save your Hearthstone for this so you can get back to Boralus quickly.

## New Profession Recipes

The new profession recipes are learnt from your Allies in Nazjatar after you unlock the intial base.

## Mechagon

To unlock the Mechagon Island, continue on Nazjatar until you get a quest to speak to Tinkmaster Overspark. This takes another 20 minutes.

The Dungeon is not out until Season 3.

## Next Steps

### Unlocking more Azerite essences

You can now start unlocking more Azerite Essences, more details on a later post.

### Unlocking minor azerite powers

You'll unlock minor azerite powers at level 55 and level 65. So get farming.
